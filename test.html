            <h2>1 Introduction</h2>
            <p><b>
                People have always copied things. In the past, most items of value were physical objects.  Patent law<br>
                and economies of scale meant that small scale copying of physical objects was usually uneconomic, and<br>
                large-scale copying (if it infringed) was stoppable using policemen and courts.  Today, things of value<br>
                are increasingly less tangible: often they are just bits and bytes or can be accurately represented as bits and bytes. 
            </b></p>
            <p> 
                T3he widespread deployment of packet-switched networks and the huge advances in computers and codec-<br> 
                technologies has made it feasible (and indeed attractive) to deliver such digital works over the Internet.  This<br>
                presents great opportunities and great challenges.  The opportunity is low-cost delivery of personalized,<br>
                desirable high-quality content.  The challenge is that such content can be distributed illegally.  Copyright law<br>
                governs the legality of copying and distribution of such valuable data, but copyright protection is<br>
                increasingly strained in a world of programmable computers and high-speed networks.</p>
            <p><em>
                For example, consider the staggering burst of creativity by authors of computer programs that are designed<br>
                to share audio files.  This was first popularized by Napster, but today several popular applications and<br>
                services offer similar capabilities.  CD-writers have become mainstream, and DVD-writers may well follow<br>
                suit.  Hence, even in the absence of network connectivity, the opportunity for low-cost, large-scale file<br>
                sharing exists.

            <h2>2  The Darknet</h2>
            <p>
                Throughout this paper, we will call the shared items (e.g. software programs, songs, movies, books, etc.)<br> 
                objects. <ins>The persons who copy objects</ins> will be called users of the darknet, and the computers used to share<br> 
                 objects will be called hosts.
            </p>
            <p>
                The darknet is the distribution network that emerges from the injection of objects according to assumption 1<br>
                and the distribution of <b>those objects according to assumptions 2 and 3</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                One implication of the first assumption is that any content protection system will leak popular or interesting<br>
                content into the darknet, because some fraction of users--possibly experts–will overcome any copy<br>
                prevention mechanism or because the object will enter the darknet before copy protection occurs. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>The term “widely distributed”</b> is intended to capture the notion of mass market distribution of objects to<br>
                 thousands or millions of practically anonymous users. <em><ins>This is in contrast to the protection of military,</ins></em><br>
                  industrial, or personal secrets, which are typically not widely distributed and are not the focus of this paper.

            <h2>2.1 Central Internet Servers</h2>
            <p>
                By 1998, a new form of the darknet began to emerge from technological advances in several areas. The<br>
                internet had become mainstream, and as such its protocols and infrastructure could now be relied upon by<br>
                anyone seeking to connect users with a centralized service or with each other. The continuing fall in the price<br>
                of storage together with advances in compression technology had also crossed the threshold at which storing<br> 
                large numbers of audio files was no longer an obstacle to mainstream users. Additionally, the power of<br>
                computers had crossed the point at which they could be used as rendering devices for multimedia content.<br>
                Finally, “CD ripping” became a trivial method for content injection.

                <b><em>The first embodiments of this new darknet were central<br>
                internet servers with large collections of MP3 audio files. A<br>
                fundamental change that came with these servers was the<br>
                use of a new distribution network: The internet displaced the<br>
                sneaker net – at least for audio content. This solved several<br>
                problems of the old darknet.  First, latency was reduced drastically.</em></b>

                Secondly, and more importantly, discovery of objects became<br>
                much easier because of simple and powerful search<br>
                mechanisms – most importantly the general-purpose<br>
                world-wide-web search engine. The local view of the<br>
                small world was replaced by a global view of the entire<br> 
                collection accessible by all users. The main characteristic of this form of the darknet was centralized storage<br>
                and search – a simple architecture that<br>
                mirrored mainstream internet servers.

            <p><em>
                Centralized or quasi-centralized distribution and service networks make sense for legal online commerce.<br>
                Bandwidth and infrastructure costs tend to be low, and having customers visit a commerce site means the<br>
                merchant can display adverts, collect profiles, and bill efficiently.  Additionally, management, auditing, and<br>
                accountability are much easier in a centralized model.

                However, centralized schemes work poorly for illegal object distribution because large, central servers are<br>
                large single points of failure: If the distributor is breaking the law, it is relatively easy to force him to stop.<br>
                Early MP3 Web and FTP sites were commonly “hosted” by universities, corporations, and ISPs.  Copyright-<br>
                holders or their representatives sent “cease and desist” letters to these web-site operators and web-owners<br>
                citing copyright infringement and in a few cases followed up with legal action [15].  The threats of legal<br>
                action were successful attacks on those centralized networks, and MP3 web and FTP sites disappeared from<br>
                the mainstream shortly after they appeared.
